## Behind The Scenes

Customer rewards points are calculated as follows:

+ Customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in a given transaction
+ Customer receives an additional point for every dollar spent over $50 in a single transaction
+ Ex: $120 purchase --> 2x$20 + 1X$50 = 90 Rewards Points
